## Offline Support

This app uses [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) to generate a service worker as part of the build step to load quickly and work offline.

## Manifest

With Chromium based browsers for Android (Chrome, Opera, etc...), Angular 2 HN includes a Web App Manifest that allows you to install to your homescreen.

## Themes

Built in theme engine!

Current themes:
* Default
* Night
* Black (AMOLED)

More to come!

## Areas of improvement

 - Realtime updating using the Firebase SDK (may need to add option to settings so service worker can still rely on REST endpoints)
 - Server side rendering

Feel free to send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh) or [file an issue](https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn/issues/new)! Feature requests are always welcome.

## Build process

This project is built with [Angular](https://angular.dev) and the Angular CLI. It requires an active Node.js LTS release (Node 20+).

 - Clone or download the repo
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` to run the application with the dev server, or `npm run build` to kick off a fresh production build and update the output directory (`dist/`)

The production build (`npm run build`) compiles ahead-of-time and generates the Angular service worker (`ngsw-worker.js`), so offline/PWA behavior can be verified by serving the contents of `dist/angular-hnpwa/browser`.

## Quality checks

 - `npm run lint` &mdash; lint the project with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) (via [angular-eslint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint))
 - `npm test` &mdash; run unit tests with Karma + Jasmine
 - `npm run e2e` &mdash; run end-to-end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
