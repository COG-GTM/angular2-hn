## Offline Support

This app uses [vite-plugin-pwa](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) (Workbox) to generate a service worker as part of the production build step to load quickly and work offline.

## Manifest

With Chromium based browsers for Android (Chrome, Opera, etc...), Angular 2 HN includes a Web App Manifest that allows you to install to your homescreen.

## Themes

Built in theme engine!

Current themes:
* Default
* Night
* Black (AMOLED)

More to come!

## Areas of improvement

 - Realtime updating using the Firebase SDK (may need to add option to settings so service worker can still rely on REST endpoints)
 - Server side rendering

Feel free to send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh) or [file an issue](https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn/issues/new)! Feature requests are always welcome.

## Stack

 - [React](https://react.dev/) with TypeScript
 - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing (`ItemDetails` and `User` are lazy loaded)
 - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the dev server and production build
 - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for the theme engine
 - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for tests

## Build process

 - Clone or download the repo
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` to run the application with the Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
 - `npm run build` to type check and produce a production build in `dist/`
 - `npm run lint` and `npm test` to lint and run the test suite

Note: the service worker is only generated for production builds. To test service worker changes:
 - `npm run build`
 - `npm run preview` to serve `dist/` along with the generated service worker
