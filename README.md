## Offline Support

This app uses [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) (through [vite-plugin-pwa](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/)) to generate a service worker as part of the build step to load quickly and work offline.

## Manifest

With Chromium based browsers for Android (Chrome, Opera, etc...), React HN includes a Web App Manifest that allows you to install to your homescreen.

## Themes

Built in theme engine!

Current themes:
* Default
* Night
* Black (AMOLED)

More to come!

## Areas of improvement

 - Realtime updating using the Firebase SDK (may need to add option to settings so service worker can still rely on REST endpoints)
 - Server side rendering

Feel free to send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh) or [file an issue](https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn/issues/new)! Feature requests are always welcome.

## Stack

React 18 + TypeScript, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), SCSS and
[vite-plugin-pwa](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) for the service worker. Tests run on
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) with
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for end-to-end coverage.

## Build process

 - Clone or download the repo
 - `npm install`
 - `npm run dev` to run the application on `localhost:4200`, or `npm run build` to kick off a fresh production build into `dist/`

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server on port 4200 |
| `npm run build` | Type check and build to `dist/`, including the service worker |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally (service worker included) |
| `npm test` | Run the unit and component test suite |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run the test suite with coverage thresholds enforced |
| `npm run e2e` | Run the Playwright end-to-end suite against a dev server |
| `npm run lint` | Lint with ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check with `tsc --noEmit` |

Note: the service worker is only generated for production builds, so run `npm run build && npm run preview` to test
offline behaviour locally.
